Although the Shopify Customizer was used for more advanced features like the cart, the vast majority of the visual components were built from the ground up. Note that small changes have been made to the site since I stopped working on it, but overall the code remains largely the same."

        with the images displayed updating automatically every day. Users can create accounts, like posts, add comments, and save images to their profile for later viewing. The application also features a pop-out feature on \

        custom badge users are also prompted for information such as name, employee ID, and a url for a picture. If the random generation is chosen, 10 badges are generated with all inputs randomly pulled from the API. Once generated, \
        badges should feature all relevant information on a badge template in png format which can then be downloaded."

        The application allows users to use a variety of different crud requests to simulate a social network. Once a user is created, they can post thoughts, add other users as friends, as well as react to other users thoughts."
